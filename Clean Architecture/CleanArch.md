## 🔄 Clean Architecture Overview
Flutter Clean Architecture follows a structured approach by dividing the project into three main layers:

### 🟢 Inner Circle: **Data Layer**
- Core functionalities that are **not visible** to the UI.
- Receives data from the **Business layer**.
- Sends API requests and returns responses.
- Manages local and remote data sources.

### 🔵 Middle Circle: **Business Layer**
- Acts as an **intermediary** between the UI and Data layers.
- Takes events from the **UI layer** and processes them.
- Contains business logic, making it reusable and testable.

### 🟠 Outer Circle: **Presentation Layer**
- The **biggest layer** (users directly interact with it).
- Handles **UI elements, state management, and user interactions**.
- Communicates with the **Business layer** for data and actions.

## 📂 Layers Breakdown

### 🎨 **Presentation Layer**
- **Widgets** → UI components
- **Providers & BLoCs** → State management
- **Screens & Pages** → Organizes UI

### ⚙️ **Business Layer**
- **Entities** → Core objects used across layers
- **Repositories** → Interfaces for data operations
- **Use Cases** → Business logic implementation

### 🛢️ **Data Layer**
- **Models** → Defines structure for data handling
- **Repositories** → Implements data fetching logic
- **Data Sources** → Manages local and remote storage

## 🔁 Workflow Cycle
1. **User interacts with the UI (Presentation Layer)**
2. **Business Layer processes events and calls appropriate Use Cases**
3. **Use Cases communicate with Data Layer to fetch/store data**
4. **Data Layer returns data (from API or local storage) to Business Layer**
5. **Business Layer sends processed data back to UI**
6. **UI updates dynamically**

## ❓ Why Do We Require Three Layers?
✅ **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a distinct responsibility.
✅ **Scalability:** Makes it easier to expand and modify features.
✅ **Maintainability:** Debugging and testing become more manageable.
✅ **Reusability:** Business logic is separated and reusable across different parts of the app.
✅ **Testability:** Unit testing becomes more efficient with a clear separation of UI, logic, and data.
